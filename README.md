# hello-github

As you can see from the descritpion, this is my first repository. This is going to be really exciting sharing code and projects among developers and maintaining versions on the cloud. As the MicroSoft CEO said, if you are not receptive to the changes and don't change accordingly, you wouldn't exist. Not too many tech companies are 41 years old!
